# The Shiny Pokemon Checklist Version 2 
## Overview
The Shiny Pokemon Checklist version 2 is rebuilt in the React framework with some exciting improvements. The database was updated to a PostgreSQL database that holds user data enabling the website to work anywhere and from any device. Now users need only to know there login information to acess their shiny pokemon checklists. The database is sercure and all passwords are hashed and stored with the help of the package bcryptjs. JSON web token was also a package implemented into this project so that users do not have to login every single time the acess the website, making it easier for users to see their checklists again and again. The styling for the project was rigorously tested on all devices and using media queries to reshape the desgin of the sight to fit perfectly on any users screen. Lastly the site includes a list of every Pokemon from every game that was created from scratch.
